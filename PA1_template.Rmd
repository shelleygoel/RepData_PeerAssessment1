```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r activity}
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r steps_per_day}
steps_per_day <- tapply(activity$steps[!is.na(activity$steps)],activity$date[!is.na(activity$steps)],FUN=sum)
hist(steps_per_day,col="red",
     main="Total number steps taken per day",
     xlab="steps per day")
mean_steps <- mean(steps_per_day[!is.na(steps_per_day)])
median_steps <- median(steps_per_day[!is.na(steps_per_day)])
```

The mean and median of total number of steps taken per day are 
`r as.integer(mean_steps)` and `r median_steps` respectively.

## What is the average daily activity pattern?




## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
